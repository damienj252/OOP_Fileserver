#Overview:
Multi-threaded file server application that allows a client application to download files using certain options . 

#Requirements:
The client should be presented a menu option in a terminal window. There should be a file called oop.jar archive containing a full set of classes for the project.
A while loop must be used to loop the menu to keep repeating until the user decides to quit the program.
When the application opens it should parse an xml file using the DOM and extract values required to interact with the remote server.

#Running the application:
java -cp .:./oop.jar ie.gmit.sw.Server 7777/path/to/myfiles

#What I would do if I had more time:
I would spend more time researching how to download the file from the server and try get a better understaning of the project requirements. 
I spent a lot of time programming instead I should have come up with a plan on how to complete the project fully.
